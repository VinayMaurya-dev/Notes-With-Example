C#-developed by :- Hejalberg in 2000.


.NET FRAMEWORK
--------------------------
.NET :- it was developed dy Microsoft team mainly by ANDERS & HEGALBERG in 2000. It is a framework by Microsoft that provides a environment to write and the whole application on a single plateform .


.NET IDE- VISUAL STUDIO
During the development of .NET,C# was  developed.

C -C++ - C#

C# :- C# is general purpose ,high level obeject oriented programming language.
Many other programming languages are just used to develop a single type of application but C# is used to develop Console based application Web application and Mobile Application.

Besides C# other 30+ Programming languages are provided by Microsoft with .NET fremework .According to the  developer choice any language can be used in development.

But mostly used programming language with .NET is C# . It is the extension of c++.


Obeject Oriented Programming Language :-
****************************************
obejct Oriented Programming language mainly provides two feature to the programming .
First is Security and seconds is Code Reusabilty. In object Oriented programming language every methods are encapsulated/written within classes.

pascal
------
all first word will be capital letter.

What is namespace:-
------------------------
Namespace is the collection of multiple classes. Namespace is the logical collection normally can be think as a folder containing multiple.cs files.

By default, the main namespace of the C# is system.

If you want to acces any class declared within a namespace then firstly we have to include the namespace in file.

Syntax:-
----------
using NameSpace_name;

Classes:-
-------
Classes is the collection data_member and member_function.
In simple word classes is the collection of multiple variables and methods.

Any variables/method declared in the class, is directly accessible in any other methods. You do not need to create instance of the class.

Only static member can not access the non-static members of the class.

Syntax:-
-------
class class_name
{
Data_member(variable);
Member_function(methods);

}

One Dimensional Array:- 
********************
one Dimensional array  also called 1D array is used to  store multiple value in a series on different index of array.

int[] arr_name=new int[size];
Length: Length is the Property of array which is used to get total number of element in array.

Many function are used to the array type can be called by using Array class.

for the Example:-
---------------
Array.Sort(array);
Array.IndexOf()
Array.Reverse() 

*******************************************************************************
Two Dimensional Array:-
*********************
Also called 2D array . It is used to store values in form of rows and column., like a table,a matrix. In 2D array number of column in each rows are same. it can not be different.

Syntax to declare a 2D array:-
*************************
Data_type[,] array_name=new data_type[rows_size,column_name];

Example:-
--------
Let's Create 2D Array with 2 rows and 3 Column to store int type value.

int[,] arr=new int[2,3];

Direct Initialization :-
*********************
int[,] arr=new int[,] {{2,3,4},{4,5,7}}
Console.WriteLine(arr.Length);

int[,] arr={{2,3,4},{4,5,7}}
Console.WriteLine(arr.Length);

 //wap to input a matrix of 3*4 and print element in matrix format.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object oriented programming language :
	it is a programming paradigm which provides a well managed way to program.
It enclose all member and function in a single unit named class.
Class:-
--------
       class is the collection of data member(properties) and member function.
 	

Constructor:-
-------------
Constructor is method declared within the class that have same name as the class.
Constructor should not be private.
Constructor call automatic with creation of object.when we create object of a class by using 
new keyword then statements of constructor executes automatic.

So thier is no need to call constructor explicitly.

Constructor does not have any return type not void.

A class may have more that one overloaded conctructor.

An implicit Constructor is always with each class which performs initialization of class variables on behalf of programmer at the time of object creation.

So default value of class variable defined by implicit constructor is : 
int type variable 0
string type variable null
float type variable 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type of Constructor:-
--------------------------
1. Default constructor
	explicit Constructor/defined by programmer
	implicit constructor/defined by compilar
2.Paramerterized Constructor
3.Copy Constructor
4.static constructor
