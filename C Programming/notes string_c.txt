strcmp():-
it is same  as strcmp() bit it ignore the casex of character of both t. it also takes two string type arguments and returns a integer type value.


strncmp:- it is  same as dtrcmp() so it also compare that two given strings are equal or not.

but it compare both strings till a given length.it need 3 arguments, first two pf strings type and last one of integer type. and returns a integer type value same as strcmp().

*******************************************************************
strnicmp():-
********
 strnicmp() is same as strncmp() but it ignore the cases used in both string.
 so it compare to string till n number of character and ignores the cases of strings.
  it returns 0 if first n character are same or returns any positive or negetive value.
 
  Syntax:-
  Int res=strnicmp(string_1, string_2,n);
  -------------------
  Strrev():-
 ***************
it reverse the value of a string. It takes only one argument and after the execution of function string value will be reverse of previous value.

*****************
strwr();-
strwr() is used to convert all character of string to the lowercase.
it accept only one argument and sets the argument  value to the lowercase.

char name[]="TECHPILE";
Syntax: strwr(name);
*********************
strupr:-
********
strupr() is a function accpets only string type argument
 and  sets the argument value to it's uppercase.

 strcat :-
*********
strcat() function is used to concatenate two string type values and assing into first argument.
Syntax:-
strcat(string_1,string_2);
it takes 2 string type value as argument and returns nothing.

*******************************

strncat:-
*********
It is same as strcat() but takes 3 argument. First two argument is a string type value to be concatenated and third one is a integer type value which shows how  many charcater of second will be concatenated to the first string.

strncat(strint_1,string_2,n);
